Welcome to my machine learning model website! In this repo, you will find the source code and the items I used to build this project.
To run the website, I have a link connected to a site that will show the website I have created, which is linked here:

About my model:
The model uses basic linear regression to estimate how schools that play in the same conference as MSU Denver will perform for the next season.
Limitations:
  - The model is a small sample size, leaving room for bias.
  - The model only predicts RMAC teams, not other NCAA Teams in the same division.
  - The features used, while useful, don't utilize features that are more complex, things like ball park factor, team's conference difficulty, and other small variables can lead to discrepancies
    in the dataset.
